## Boltzmann transport applications meeting
Wednesday 4th December 2019: 10:00 - 16:00

The meeting is centred on bringing together academics and industry that work on solving Boltzmann-type problems in a range of different application areas. The idea behind this meeting is to try and foster collaboration between different disciplines, to exchange knowledge on methods and tools and help improve all our abilities in tackling difficult multi-dimensional Boltzmann problems.

This year, the meeting will be hosted by the Applied Computational and Modelling Group (AMCG) at Imperial College London and we believe would be of interest to mathematicians, scientists and engineers in fields as diverse as:
- Nuclear engineering
- Radiative transfer in different disciplines
- Lattice Boltzmann methods for fluids
- Astrophysics
- Vlasov/Boltzmann equations
- Spectral wave modelling
- Medical radiation
- Reduced order modelling for Boltzmann applications

The meeting will be comprised of a series of 20-30 minute talks, along with focused discussion sessions. The first talk in the morning session will give an introduction to Boltzmann transport modelling in different applications, with the aim of setting a common language to facilitate discussions that follow.
